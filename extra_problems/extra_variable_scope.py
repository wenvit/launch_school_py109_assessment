# count = 10

# def increment_counter():
#     count = count + 1
#     return count

# print(increment_counter()) 

# Solution:
# This raises an UnboundLocalError. When Python encounters the 
# assignment of `count` variable within the `increment_counter`
# function, it interprets it as a local variable. However, on the 
# right side of the assignment operator `=`, `count` hasn't been
# defined locally. To fix, can either use `global count` which would
# reassign the global variable, or rename to a new local variable such 
# as new_count = count + 1

# message = "Hello"

# def change_message():
#     global message  
#     message = "Goodbye" 

# change_message()
# print(message) 

# Solution:
# This will print: Goodbye
# When `change_message` is called, the `global message`
# statement tells Python that the global `message` variable
# is used inside the function. So `message = 'Goodbye'`
# reassigns the global `message` variable to 'Goodbye'. This
# is a reassignment because strings are immutable. When `print`
# is called passing `message` as an argument, it prints the 
# reassigned global variable. This is an example of a function 
# with side effects.

# items = [1, 2, 3]

# def add_item():
#     items.append(4)

# def replace_items():
#     items = [5, 6, 7] 

# add_item()  
# print(items) 
# replace_items() 
# print(items) 


# Solution:

# This will print:
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
# [1, 2, 3, 4]

# The global `items` variable is initialized to a list `[1, 2, 3]`
# When `add_item` is called, the function mutates the global `items`
# object by appending `4`. The `print` function is called with `items`
# as an argument and prints the mutated global object `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
# `replace_items` is called, which initializes a local `items` variable
# to a list `[5, 6, 7]`. When a variable is initialized within a function,
# it's a local variable, separate from a global variable even though it has
# the same name. This is an example of variable shadowing. So the global
# `items` is not mutated by `replace_items` and the next print call 
# prints `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

# def outer_function():
#     x = 50

#         x = 25 
#         print("Inner:", x)
    
#     inner_function()
#     print("Outer:", x)

# outer_function()
# print("Global:", x)


# This will print: 

# Inner: 25
# Outer: 50
# Global: 100

# Global `x` is initialized to 100.
# Within `outer_function`, separate `x` variable initialized to 50. 
# This is a separate variable available within `outer_function` shadows
# global `x`. Within `inner_function`, separate `x` variable initialized
# to 25. Again this is a separate variable available within `inner_function`
# that shadows other `x` variables in outer scopes. The `outer_function` is 
# called, which calls `inner_function`, which calls `print('Inner:', x)`. 
# This is the `x` available in `inner_function` which is 25.
#  Then `print('Outer:', x)` is executed. This is `x` available in `outer_function`
# which is 50. Finally, `print('Global;', x)` executes which references global `x`
# which is 100. Illustrates global scope, variable shadowing

#     user_data = {"name": "Guest", "points": 0} 

# update_name()
# print(user_data) 
# reset_user()
# print(user_data) 


# Solution:
# This will print:
# {'name': 'Bob', 'points': 0}
# {'name': 'Bob', 'points': 0}

# Global `user_data` variable is initialized to a dictionary object
# `{"name": "Alice", "points": 0}`.
# `update_name` is called, which mutates the global `user_data` dict 
# object by updating the value associated with the `name` key to 'Bob'.
# The first `print` call passing `user_data` as an argument, prints
# the mutated global `user_data` dict object. The `reset_user` function
# is called, which initializes `user_data` to a dict object. Because
# this variable initialization occurs within the body of a function, 
# Python interprets it as a local variable, separate from the global
# `user_data` variable. This is variable shadowing. The assignment of
# dict object to the local `user_data` variable doesn't mutate the
# global `user_data` variable. So the next `print` call prints the same
# `user_data` object as above. Illustrates variable scope, variable shadowing, 
# function with side effects

#     return lst

# numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# result = modify_list(numbers) 

# print(numbers) 
# print(result) 

# Solution:
# This will print:
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
# [10, 20, 30, 40]
# Global `numbers` variable is initialized to a list object `[1, 2, 3]`.
# `modify_list` function is called passing `numbers` object by reference.
# `modify_list` function is defined with a parameter `lst`. Global `numbers`
# and local `lst` variables point to the same object when the function is called.
# `lst.append(4)` mutates the global list object by appending `4`. `numbers` points 
# to the mutated list. On the next line in the function body, the local variable 
# `lst` is reassigned to a new list object `[10, 20, 30]`. This reassignment of the 
# local variable doesn't impact the global `numbers` object. Then the local `lst`
# is mutated by appending `40`. The mutated local `lst` return value is
# `[10, 20, 30, 40]` which is assigned to the `result` variable.
# `print(numbers)` outputs `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and `print(result)` outputs
# `[10, 20, 30, 40]`
# This demonstrates variable scope, mutability of lists, passing by object reference,
# and function side effects (mutating global object from within function)

# What does the following code do and why? 

# total = 10

# def update_total():
#     total = total + 5 
#     return total

# print(update_total())

# Solution: 
# This will raise an UnboundLocalError on line 186 because when Python
# encounters a variable assignment within the body of a function, it assumes
# it's assignment of a local variable. The expression `total + 5` on the right
# side of the assignment statement raises the error because `total` hasn't 
# been assigned locally yet.

# total = 10

#     value = value + 5  
#     return value

# result = update_total(total) 

# print(total)  
# print(result)  

# Solution:
# This will print:
# 10
# 15
# This is because `update_total` is called passing the global variable
# `total` as an argument. Within `update_total`, the local variable (parameter)
# `value` is reassigned by adding 5, which gets returned to `result`. So printing
# `result` outputs `15`. The global variable `total` remains `10` because integers 
# are immutable.
# This demonstrates variable scope

# What is the output of this code?

# lst1 = [0, 1, 2, 3] 
# lst2 = lst1.pop(0) and lst1.pop() 

# if lst2:
#     print(2, lst2)
# else:
#     print(1, lst1) 


# Solution


# This will print:
# 1 [1, 2, 3]

# In the assignment of lst2 , the expression lst1.pop(0) and lst1.pop() 
# returns 0. This is because applying the pop method with the argument 0 
# to lst1 returns the integer 0 which is the element at the index 0 of lst1 (first element).  
# This is a mutating operation on lst1. 
# Because 0 is falsy, the and expression 
# short circuits, returns the first falsy value of 0, and the right subexpression 
# never executes. The value of lst1 after the mutation is [1, 2, 3]. 
# pop method returns None, so lst2 is assigned to NoneIn the 
# if/else statement, the if block doesnâ€™t execute because lst2 is 0 which is 
# falsy. The else block executes which prints 1 [1, 2, 3]
# Concepts of truthy/falsy, short circuiting, mutable lists, methods that mutate
# objects in place return None

# This will print:

# The global variable `greeting` is assigned to the list object ['Hello'].
# The `greet` function is called passing the `greeting` object by reference
# to the parameter `greeting`, which means the local
# variable `greeting` points to same list object as global `greeting`. 
# Within the `greet` function, `greeting` is mutated by the augmented assignment
# operator `+=`. The result is that the list object referenced by both the local `greeting`
# and global `greeting` variables are mutated to ['Hello', 'world'].
# When `greet` is called, the `print` call within the function prints `greeting` 
# which references `['Hello', 'world']`. Then `print` is called passing global
# `greeting` which prints the same list object `['Hello', 'world']`. 
# This demonstrates variable scope, mutability of lists.
