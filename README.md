This is a github repository created by Wendy Vit for 
preparing for the Launch School **PY109 Assessment: Programming Foundations with Python: Basics**

Many of the problems used to prepare for the PY109 assessment are ones I already developed python code solutions for in the Prep and PY101 courses. For PY109, my focus is on making sure I have an in depth understanding of the code solutions and also on writing clear, precise, concise explanations of what the code is doing and the key concepts each problem/solution illustrates.

The intro_to_programming_with_python folder contains solutions for all exercises in each chapter of the *Introduction to Programming with Python* book. 

The python_basics_exercises contains solutions for selected problems from Python Basics Exercises.
