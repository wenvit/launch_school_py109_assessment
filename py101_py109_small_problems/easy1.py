# Tip Calculator

# Sum or Product of Consecutive Integers
# Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer

# Leap Years (Part 1)
# Write a function that takes any year greater than 0 as input
#  and returns True if the year is a leap year, or False if it is not.

# For simplicity, this exercise assumes that the Gregorian calendar 
# has been in continuous use since the year 1. We'll address that
#  assumption in the next exercise that follows this one.

# To determine whether a given year is a leap year, use the
# rules of the Gregorian calendar:

# If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
# If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year.
# If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year.
# All other years are not leap years.

# Leap Years (Part 2)
# In the previous exercise, we assumed that the Gregorian calendar

# every 4 years.

# in 1752, England, Ireland, and the British colonies all 
# switched to the Gregorian calendar. Update the function

# prior to 1752, and the Gregorian calendar starting in 1752.
